		<description>Enter a pdspec in the form of a boolean lambda expression that checks the result of the desired expression.</description>

		<description>Enter an expression that evaluates to the value you desire.</description>

	<context id="skeleton" title="Synthesis">
		<description>Enter an outline of the desired expression, using ??s for unknown pieces.  You can also use ** as the sole argument to a method when you do not know how many arguments it should have.</description>

	<context id="candidate-selector" title="Synthesis">
		<description>Check the expressions that you would like to insert into the document.  If you choose more than one expression, then if some have different values when we later encounter this statement, we will ask you for a new pdspec.</description>

	<context id="search-native-calls" title="Synthesis">
		<description>Allow the synthesis search to call native methods outside the standard library (i.e., outside the "java." and "sun." packages).  These method calls might not respect the security manager and so might have external side effects, such as deleting a file.  However, disallowing them greatly slows the search.</description>
	</context>
	<context id="handle-side-effects" title="Synthesis">
		<description>Log and undo all side effects during execution.  This makes the search sound (unless it also searches native calls) but is slower.</description>
